# README 

## Update 11-01-2019

I stopped being a lazy guy and changed the current code execution stuff:

- All hard-coded, property holding dictionaries inside main.py are removed.
- Instead, a "config.json" file is created and the main code will ask this file's path (as argument) from you to run the project, properly. 
- Detailed description of this file will be added into this readme (but until I write it, you can always open the file. Believe me, it is not too complicate =)). 
- With respect to new kind of property handling, I changed every related variable/argument initialization in the main and model files. 
- ~~A complete README.MD overhaul is coming on its way~~. (Done!)
- Still, I have not tested Transformer code. Don't be mad at me if you c/p it and can't get results for your homework(s) =)
- Tests are really really slow in CPU workstation and I still play games in my daily-life computer instead of running experiments.

  
## Introduction

Finally, I decided to do my all machine learning, NLP stuff by using PyTorch. The reason is simple actually, I like it more than Tensorflow =) 
Eventually, I won't update the other text_categorization repository, but I will continue to develop same ideas in here. 

## Versions

Before diving into details, the python and library versions are as follows: 

- python 3.6 (works well with 3.7, too)
- torch 1.0.0
- torchtext 0.3.1
- numpy 1.15.4 (due to PyTorch 1.0)
- setuptools 40.6.2 (Hell no idea why pipreqs put this into requirements.txt)
- spacy 2.0.16 (for interactive evaluation only)
- gensim 3.6.0 (for fasttext embeddings, as well as OOV Embedding generation.)

## Code Details

- As the other Tensorflow-based repository, I will use the dataset that me and my old colleagues constructed 3 years ago. "English/Turkish Wikipedia Named-Entity Recognition and Text Categorization Dataset" is publicly available: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/cdcztymf4k/1
- Initial commit introduces basic Text CNN (from 2014 paper). More models will be added.
- Fasttext embeddings are used (by default but it can be changed). Eventually, one can use Torchtext to download the "pre-defined" embedding files. However, since Turkish embeddings were not included in, I manually edit the Torchtext backend codes (please check the "changes in the torchtext.txt" file). Also note that, everytime you update Torchtext, you need to re-add those changes again.
- Embeddings (whether random or pretrained) can be "static", "nonstatic", or "multichannel".
- For OOV words, OOVEmbeddingCreator is developed (under datahelper/embedding_helper). There are 5 different basic approaches defined to generate OOV embeddings: (1) zeros vector, (2) ones vector, (3) random vector (between 0, 1), (4) (r1, r2) ranged uniformly random vector, (5) Fasttext CharNgram-based vectors.
- Even though I am focusing on Turkish versions of the dataset, I believe "Preprocessor" can work for English dataset, too. In future, I may add more language specific methods. 
- Due to laziness, I defined all my necessary arguments/configs/properties in "main.py". However, I also implemented argparse versions of the same properties but it may lack recent updated properties (Sorry for hard-coded paths). 
- I tested all training, evaluation, model/vocabulary saving/loading aspects of the code for several epochs without any problem (except out of memory errors =)).

## To-do 

- [x] ~~Better configuration/property reading, handling, instead of hard-coded dictionaries~~ (Update: 11-Jan-2019)

the Local Reparameterization Trick](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02557.pdf)~~
- [x] ~~Extend main flow and learning models with respect to new dropout models.~~ 
- [x] ~~Add character-level data preprocessing.~~
- [x] ~~Add character-level data loading.~~
- [ ] Run the current piece of code for the aforementioned datasets and define a text categorization baseline (for both Turkish and English). 
- [ ] Variational Dropout related extensions (current version is from 2015 paper but obviously more recent versions are out there for me to implement =)) + bayes by backprop for CNN (a.k.a. Bayesian CNN)
- [ ] Attention.
- [ ] Different learning algorithms (DeepCNN, LSTM, GRU, any-kind-of-hybrid versions of those algorithms, transformers).
  - [x] TextCNN
  - [x] GRU 
  - [x] LSTM
  - [x] ~~Multilayer CNN~~ (I removed this model and decided to continue with CharCNN and VDCNN instead).
  - [x] CharCNN
  - [x] VDCNN (Very Deep CNN)
  - [ ] Transformer
  - [x] Conv-Deconv CNN
  - [ ] Encoder-Decoder GRU
  - [ ] Encoder-Decoder LSTM
  - [ ] Hybrid stuff (Like CNN+LSTM/GRU)
- [ ] CRF layer to be able to do NER experiments.
- [ ] For Turkish, I plan to add morphological disambiguation (https://github.com/erayyildiz/Neural-Morphological-Disambiguation-for-Turkish). 
- [ ] Different language models.
  - [ ] ELMO (pretrained Turkish/English embeddings)
  - [ ] BERT (pretrained Turkish/English embeddings)
- [ ] Document length categorization/NER support (Conv-Deconv CNN implementation supports document-length tasks, but more support will come with ELMO and BERT update).
     
## Project Skeleton

I try to keep every part of the project clean and easy to follow. Even though the folders are self explanatory for me, let me explain them for those who may have hard time to understand.

- `./crf/CRF.py` contains the conditional random field implementation (not finished yet). 
- `./datahelper/dataset_reader.py` contains the "DatasetLoader" object that reads a text dataset, splits it into 3 subsets (train/vali/test), creates vocabulary and iterators. It is a little bit hard-coded for the dataset I am using now. However, it is easy to make changes to use it for your own dataset.
- `./datahelper/embedding_helper.py` is a helper class to generate OOV word embeddings. To use Fasttext-based OOV embedding generation, it leverages Gensim!
- `./datahelper/preprocessor.py` contains the "Preprocessor" object and actions to apply on sentences. 
- `./dropout_models/gaussian_dropout.py` contains the Gaussian Dropout object. 
- `./dropout_models/variational_dropout.py` contains the Variational Dropout object. 
- `./dropout_models/dropout.py` contains the Dropout object which you can select your dropout type among Bernoulli (basic), Gaussian and Variational dropout types. 
- `./evaluation/evaluator.py` is the factory for evaluation objects that are used in model trainings as well as interactive evaluation.
- `./evaluation/xyz_evaluator.py` methods are the evaluator functions for specified models.
- `./model/xyz.py` contains network objects.
- `./model/Util_xyz.py` contains custom-defined objects that are used in `xyz`.
- `./optimizer/custom_optimizer.py` contains custom-defined optimizer objects.
- `./training/trainer.py` is a class that returns the necessary trainer for the user's selected learning model
- `./training/xyz_trainer.py` methods are the trainer functions for specified models.
- `./utils/utils.py` contains both utility and common methods that are being used in several places in the project.
- `./main.py` is the main code. To execute this project, one needs to provide a valid `config.json` file which contains the necessary configuration properties.
- `./config.json` is the configuration file.  

## How-to-run

### Important Note Before Start

I had to make some changes in the torchtext backend codes to be able to do several stuffs:

- I don't know why, torchtext does not split a dataset into 3 subsets (train/val/test) even if there is a function for it. I changed it to fix that issue. Hopefully, one day torchtext will fix it offically =)
- To be able to work with Turkish Fasttext embeddings, I added its respective alias.
- To be able to apply Fasttext's CharNGram to OOV words to generate OOV embeddings, a minor change has been made to Vector object.

### Configuration JSON Format

To be able to run the main code, you need to provide a valid JSON file which contains 4 main properties. These are `dataset_properties`, `model_properties`, `training_properties`, and `evaluation_properties` (Check config.json for detailed view, I think definitions are pretty straightforward).

- `dataset_properties` contains dataset-related information such as path, embedding, batch information.
- `model_properties` contains model-related parameters. Inside this property,
  - `common_model_properties` contains common properties for all models like embeddings, vocabulary size, etc.
  - `model_name` (like text_cnn, char_cnn, etc.) contains model-specific properties.
- `training_properties` contains training-related properties.
- `evaluation_properties` contains evaluation-related properties.

### How to Run

If you make the necessary changes described in "changes in torchtext.txt" and prepare "config.json", you have two ways to run the code.

- If you are using an IDE, copy/paste your "config.json" file's path as an argument and press run button.
- If you are an old-school command window lover, type `python main.py --config /path/to/config.json`.

### Training from Scratch/Training from Checkpoint/Interactive Evaluation

You can train your model from 0th epoch until max_epoch, and/or continue your training from xth epoch to the end. You do not need to do anything extra for the first case; however, to be able to continue your training you need to make necessary changes in "config.json":

- If `dataset_properties/checkpoint_path` is empty, the code will start a new training process. If you type your saved PyTorch model, the main flow will automatically load it and continue from where it left.
  - Additionally, you can provide saved vocabulary files for words (`dataset_properties/saved_sentence_vocab` (don't ask why it is sentence)) and labels (`dataset_properties/saved_category_vocab`).
  
To be able to activate interactive evaluation, you need to make necessary changes in "config.json":

- Change `model_properties/common_model_properties/run_mode`'s value to "eval_interactive".
- Provide your model's path to be evaluated and your saved vocabulary files' path by using `evaluation_properties`.

## Results

This section presents the Top-1 and Top-5 test accuracies for **text categorization task** of my experiments. Due to computational resource limit, I cannot test every single parameter/hyperparameter. In general, I hold algorithm parameters same for all experiments; however, I change embedding related parameters. I assume the result table is self-explanatory. As a final note, I *won't* share my best models and I *won't* guarantee reproducibility. Dataset splits (training/validation/test) are deterministic for all experiments, but anything else that needs random initialization is non-deterministic. 

Note: Epoch is set to 20 for all experiments, until further notice (last update: 31-10-2018). However, if I believe that results may improve, I let the experiment run for 10 more epochs (at most 30 epoch per experiments).
